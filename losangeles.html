		Los Angeles was the city of my youth, the place I look back on with rose-tinted sunglasses—so long as rose-tinted
		sunglasses are still in vogue—the expanse of land that has barely changed geologically yet has morphed to serve my
		different needs over the course of my 20s.
	</p>
	<p>
		Los Angeles was weekend brunch at Huckleberry in Santa Monica or, if time felt endless, The Little Door in Hollywood.
		Freshly made-up, we piled into Helen's old Volkswagon, searching for free parking in alleyways so we could pay for our
		pancakes, prosciutto, and burratta with pears. Tap water was the drink of choice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Los Angeles was sitting in traffic on Olympic as I anxiously made my way to my first coding internship, waiting on the
		10 to meet friends for kbbq, and surviving the line to leave the Century City parking lot. At least we had music,
		Helen's phone reliably on call for John Mayer or Cat's iPod ready to play any number of songs from the past 10 years.

		Los Angeles was the midnight bike ride we took down Wilshire. The cool air whipped across my face as I tried to keep up
		with friends who had longer legs, bigger bikes, more stamina. We talked and bantered and rode in silence, making sure to
		signal to those behind us if a pothole or dead skunk was in our path. The empty roads felt impossibly ours as we blazed
		through red lights and donuted circles around intersections. There was those couple months where we talked about riding
		to a taco truck in downtown LA. I did, and I continue to now, wish I went on more midnight bike rides. I loved that Los Angeles.

	<p>
		Los Angeles was standing on the side of a winding freeway halfway between Palm Springs and the middle of nowhere,
		waiting for a tow truck to pick up my overheated SMART car.
	</p>
	<p>
		Los Angeles was Gjelina with my family on my graduation day, Tar and Roses the night before I left for San Francisco,
		wearing matching holiday sweaters with ABs, baking sweet potatoes on Rochester.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most recently, Los Angeles has served as the meeting place for Thomas' friends and my own: a place where two lovers'
		worlds bloomed on completely separate planes and a convenient place for them to collide. Here I have met kind, generous,
		deeply caring people who have shown me new sides of the city I thought I knew so well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, the constant in all my memories of Los Angeles is the warmth. There is the joy-inducing sunshine warmed the
		concrete bench that warmed my fingertips, and there is also the scorching, sweltering sweat dripping down my back onto
		the carseat, having not moved more than half a mile in 30 minutes. Its permanent sunshine, serving both as the city's
		energy and lethargy, is true Los Angeles.
	</p>
	<p>
		I dislike Los Angeles, but I mostly like Los Angeles. My history and a place of nostalgic comfort, Los Angeles is not a
		place for me to live but a city for me to be a true creature of my senses. I hope to visit again soon.
